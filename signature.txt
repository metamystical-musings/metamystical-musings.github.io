The file https://metamystical-musings.github.io/Metamystical-Musings.pdf was created by MisterY on July 21, 2023
and signed by him using https://hash-and-sign.github.io -- a web page he created from open source Ed25519 DSA software.

To verify the signature:

1. Compute the SHA256 checksum of the PDF. The technique for doing so depends on your operating system. 
   This guide may be useful: https://technastic.com/check-md5-checksum-hash

2. Confirm that the SHA256 checksum matches the first line of this file.

3. Copy and paste the first four lines of this file (above the double-line) into the lower box (Message to 
   sign/verify) of https://hash-and-sign.github.io -- It doesn't matter what is in the upper box (12 random words).

4. Just below the lower box is a Status message. If the status is "verified" then the PDF has not been altered 
   since signing by the owner of the public key.

5. Confirm that the pubic key belongs to MisterY. He published his public key on his substack here:
